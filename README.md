# Disease_prediction Version 0.1


## Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having a disease based on their symptoms using machine learning. The logistic regression algorithm is used for prediction. The dataset used in this project is taken from Kaggle, which is free to use.

### Files

This repository contains the following files:

- `disease_prediction.py`: Python program that takes user inputs for symptoms and predicts the likelihood of a disease.
- `disease_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the same code as `disease_prediction.py`.
- `Training.csv`: Dataset used for training the machine learning model.
- `disease_pred.pkl`: Saved machine learning model for disease prediction.

### Usage

To use the disease prediction model, simply run the `disease_prediction.py` program in a Python environment. The program will prompt the user to enter symptoms separated by commas, and will output the predicted disease.

### Dependencies

The following Python packages are required to run this project:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

### How to run the program

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
3. Run the `disease_prediction.py` file using `python disease_prediction.py` command.
